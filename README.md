## Projects

### Project 1: Sentiment Analysis with Python
A Python project where I used Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze sentiment in text data. The goal was to build a sentiment classifier to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of text reviews.

### Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Data Science)
Conducted exploratory data analysis on a dataset related to real estate prices. Leveraged Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize data patterns and gain insights.
